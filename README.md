<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

Setup Resources in Azure
- Create the Domain Controller VM (Windows Server 2022) named “DC-1”
    Take note of the Resource Group and Virtual Network (Vnet) that get created at this time
- Set Domain Controller’s NIC Private IP address to be static
- Create the Client VM (Windows 10) named “Client-1”. Use the same Resource Group and Vnet that was created in Step 1.a
- Ensure that both VMs are in the same Vnet (you can check the topology with Network Watcher

Ensure Connectivity between the client and Domain Controller
- Login to Client-1 with Remote Desktop and ping DC-1’s private IP address with ping -t <ip address> (perpetual ping)
- Login to the Domain Controller and enable ICMPv4 in on the local windows Firewall
- Check back at Client-1 to see the ping succeed

Install Active Directory
- Login to DC-1 and install Active Directory Domain Services
- Promote as a DC: Setup a new forest as mydomain.com (can be anything, just remember what it is)
- Restart and then log back into DC-1 as user: mydomain.com\labuser

Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD
- In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), create an Organizational Unit (OU) called “_EMPLOYEES”
- Create a new OU named “_ADMINS”
- Create a new employee named “Jane Doe” (same password) with the username of “jane_admin”
- Add jane_admin to the “Domain Admins” Security Group
- Log out/close the Remote Desktop connection to DC-1 and log back in as “mydomain.com\jane_admin”
- User jane_admin as your admin account from now on


Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
- From the Azure Portal, set Client-1’s DNS settings to the DC’s Private IP address
- From the Azure Portal, restart Client-1
- Login to Client-1 (Remote Desktop) as the original local admin (labuser) and join it to the domain (computer will restart)
- Login to the Domain Controller (Remote Desktop) and verify Client-1 shows up in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) inside the “Computers” container on     the root of the domain
- Create a new OU named “_CLIENTS” and drag Client-1 into there


Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Log into Client-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin and open system properties
- Click “Remote Desktop”
- Allow “domain users” access to remote desktop
- You can now log into Client-1 as a normal, non-administrative user now
- Normally you’d want to do this with Group Policy that allows you to change MANY systems at once (maybe a future lab)

Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users
- Login to DC-1 as jane_admin
- Open PowerShell_ise as an administrator
- Create a new File and paste the contents of the script into it (https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1)
- Run the script and observe the accounts being created
- When finished, open ADUC and observe the accounts in the appropriate OU
- attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the accounts (take note of the password in the script)
